# kahoot-hack-bots-flood
This is a program just for fun, when you download and use it you agree that I have no responsibility of your acts. You need to start in your localhost that sends robots to a kahoot game

# Warning

This program uses a hide browser in your computer to work, so don't abuse it, this will create 7 bots when you send the data, 7 bots is 7 tabs in your browser, and this will open another browser window if you click in the button again!

# Instructions

- Open cmd, type the project uri
- Then type:

> node index.js

- Then open your favorite browser using this url: http://localhost:3333
